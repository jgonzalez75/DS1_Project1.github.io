    <h1>Welcome to the graphs page</h1>
    <p>With this page you will be able to see the data i was able to collect within the time span given. </p>

      <h1>My first peice of evidence was the graph i compiled using seaborn and pandas modules in python.</h1>
      <img src='download (1).png'>
       
<h1>In terms of how i got these stats from my source you can look at my implementation with further elaboration <a href="web3.html"><button class="button" style="vertical-align:middle"><span>Here </span></button></a></h1>
      <h1>What we can gather from this graph its a bar graph that shows us the sum of each "records" in the oranization type it belongs to and we can clearly see theres one that exceeds the rest, which is <u>The Web was the most attacked in terms of frequency and volume of what whas stolen,sold,etc</u></h1>

      <h1>Now why would the average joe care much about cybersecurity? well it not only can digitaly affet people but it has real world effects whether its shuting down power, or even something more violent like the potential to harm someone physicaly.</h1>


      <h1>It can affect anyone regardless of whom they are.This is just statistics made from the last 10 years of this industry. One thing we could start doing is making sure every website has a https and ssl certificate, most do but not all of them, this verifies the end user's(you) personal data is safe.Since most of the data breaches/attacks have been from the web. </h1>

      <h1>But it can also work against us when we try to work against the hackers or breachers, because if you know a lot about cybersecurity, its kind of like a super power you can either use it for good or for bad, hopefully most people would use it for good. So the more we teach cybersecurity we also run into the risk of creating potential hackers or allowing them on a system for them to target.</h1>
