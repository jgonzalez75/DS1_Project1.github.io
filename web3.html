    <h1>This screenshot i took was of my code, First i needed to import the dataset, then i had to wrangle a  lot of data, about 30,000 columns of data to be exact. but the way the data was collected i didnt have much of a choice but to get rid of a lot of data into just 197 rows of data since there was a lot of "Unknown" in the data. Then after i got past that, i wanted to know which Organization type was most frequent in this data set. </h1>
