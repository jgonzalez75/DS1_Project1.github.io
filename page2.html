            <h1>Here is the next page to my research</h1>
            <b><h1> keep in mind that the data i am using is very outdated and might not be the
                 most accurate to what my claims are</h1></b>
            <h2>with the data i recieved i asked the question of 
                "Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the average likes an influencer has on a post and their influence score?"</h2>
            <h2> According to the graph #2 we can see that there is a slight correlation with the data but 
                its hard to conclude what its trying to tell us but its all clustered together and the correlation of more likes = better influencer score is there but its not very strong.
